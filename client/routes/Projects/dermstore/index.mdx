As the head of front end engineering I helped shape Dermstore's growing tech team. I created user-facing experiences, as well as a suite of tools and automated workflows to help us scale our front end and minimize day-to-day maintenance and overhead. These tools allowed us to focus on designing consistent, stable, and engaging experiences at scale.
