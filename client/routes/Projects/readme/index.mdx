I joined ReadMe as their fifth engineer helping to build the docs platform for some of the coolest companies in the industry. As a front end developer, I got to work alongside other amazingly talented design technologists to solve difficult user interface problems at scale.

As the head of front end, and eventually the entire engineering org, I learned how startups grow, and what it takes to “build a culture” from a leadership perspective. From technical strategy, to hiring,&nbsp;to helping my coworkers excel, it's been eye opening to learn more about the human side of how we build web apps.
