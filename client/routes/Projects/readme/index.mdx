I joined ReadMe as the fifth engineer, and have had a blast building out both our tech team _and_ the documentation platform for some of the biggest companies in the industry! As an engineer, I got to work alongside other amazingly talented designers and developers to solve hard UI and technical problems at scale.

As the head of front end, and eventually the entire engineering org, I got to see how startups grow, and what it really means to “build a culture” from a leadership perspective. Between technical strategy, hiring, and helping my coworkers develop in their careers, it's been eye opening to learn more about the human side of how we build web apps.
